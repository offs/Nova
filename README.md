# Nova.

Nova is an **all-in-one security tool** for your Garry's mod client

This script protects your client from all areas of attacks from servers including:

* Reading, writing and deleting files
* Sending harmful commands
* Unwanted LUA execution
* Crashing your game

~~Nova is still very much in-development and still being worked on, you _will_ experience bugs while using this at this time~~
